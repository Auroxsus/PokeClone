# PokeClone
Clone of "Pok√©mon Yellow" first generation game for game boy console, made with Pygame

I have always wanted to learn how to make a working stand alone console game that I can share. In college I was taught how to implement advanced features (pagination, semaphores, memory management, etc) but:

* College is hard so I don't remember most of it.
* I don't know how to code

Honestly, this is my attempt to utilize github and to learn python but without any sort of motivation. This is a personal learning project, and even if it hasn't been updated for a long time, I still have hopes to get into it at some point.

Features
---
* This is MY messy code but expect it to be extremely well commented.
* It's full of experiments and trying to break things.

Goal
---
A fulling working Pokemon Yellow Clone. Maybe even an attempt at a Game boy emmulator, like in the 90s!

I'm thankful to all those who will/have pointed out bugs and submitted pull requests. 

Please feel free to fork this repo. If many of you are interested in continuing the project, let me know.
